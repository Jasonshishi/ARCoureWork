Our AR puzzle game "DreamPatcher"
The code for the game I created in the AR course of my graduate program at Goldsmiths College is divided into three main sections: game mechanics, music control, and game UI. The AR generation part primarily utilizes the Vuforia plugin and ARKit for implementation.
